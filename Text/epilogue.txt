The moment the correct words leave your mouth, the air in the library shifts... subtly at first, then with a swirling, sweeping calm that settles over the room like a long-held breath finally released. The blue flames along the pilasters flicker once, twice, and then fade into soft, ordinary candlelight. The oppressive heat vanishes. The groaning of the house falls silent. For the first time since you arrived, the manor feels...  still.

Eleanor lowers her gaze, and a faint, fragile smile warms her pale features. The key at her chest glimmers softly as she drifts nearer, hovering just above the floor. When she speaks, her voice is gentle... threaded with sorrow, relief, and something far older:

'The sins of Scarlet past now lie within you.                                    Learn from our mistakes... and carry the name forward.'

Her hand lifts, graceful and weightless, and she unclasps the heart-shaped key from around her neck. She extends it to you, the metal shimmering with a faint inner light. When you take it, her cold touch brushes yours... light as dust, fleeting as a memory.

Eleanor's form begins to unravel into drifting motes of white. She doesn't fall, or fade at once; instead she lifts upward, rising slowly toward the vaulted ceiling, her outline blurring into a floating ribbon of light. At the highest point of the library, she pauses... gives one final, distant look down at you... then dissolves into nothing.

Silence settles. Then:

The library door swings open on its own.

No heat spills through it. No smoke. No flame.

When you step into the foyer, your breath catches: the chandelier hangs high above you, pristine and unmoving, its crystals catching the warm light exactly as they did the moment you first walked in. The marble floor is unscarred. There is no sign of fire, no ruin, no collapsed ceiling... nothing but the untouched stillness of a grand old house holding its secrets close.

You walk to the front door, heart-shaped key in hand. The key slides into the lock with a soft, perfect click, as though it had been waiting decades for this moment. The door unlocks easily.

Cool night air washes over you as you step outside.

The rain has slowed to a gentle mist, the storm long spent. Your car sits exactly where you left it, headlights reflecting faintly off the wet gravel. You open the door, settle behind the wheel, and start the engine. For a moment, you allow yourself one last look back at Scarlet Manor... its dark silhouette rising against the mountains, silent and watchful.

Then you shift into drive.

The tires crunch over the gravel, the house receding behind you until it disappears around the bend of the long road. The rain patters softly on the windshield, and the night ahead unfolds quiet and endless.

You leave Scarlet Manor behind.

But it does not leave you.
