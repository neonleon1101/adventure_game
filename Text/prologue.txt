You've been driving for hours, long enough that the hum of the engine has become its own kind of silence. The dashboard glow paints your hands in dim orange light, steady and warm... nothing like the cold knot twisting in your stomach. Your mother never talked about the Scarlet family. Not really. Just fragments, always whispered. A warning disguised as a memory. 'Some things aren't meant to be passed down,' she once said, staring at nothing in particular. You were too young to ask what she meant, and by the time you understood enough to try, she'd already built a wall around the subject so high it felt cruel to climb it.

And now the house, her father's house, belongs to you. 

The last living descendant of the Scarlet line. Whether you want to be or not.

Rain begins to tap against the windshield, soft at first, then steadier, like fingertips drumming nervously on glass. You tighten your grip on the wheel. Out here, the road narrows into a thin strip of cracked asphalt swallowed by the woods. No streetlights. No signs. Just the faint shine of wet leaves and your own reflection staring back at you in the rearview mirror. You think back to the gas station just outside town, the only place for miles that didn't feel half-asleep. The old man behind the counter had paused when you gave him the address. His eyes narrowed in a way that made you feel exposed, like he could see something you hadn't said aloud.

'Scarlet Manor,' he repeated, tasting the name like something sour. 'Place has always been wrong. Folks used to say it was haunted. Doors opening on their own, shadows moving where shadows shouldn't be.' He leaned in, lowering his voice even though you were the only one there. 'Weird things happen to anyone who hangs around that property. Anyone except your granddaddy, I guess... though he didn't exactly leave the house much, did he?'

A nervous chuckle, thin, and brittle. Then: 'If I were you, I would turn back.'

You didn't. Maybe you should have.

The forest parts after one final curve, revealing two stone pillars rising from the earth like grave markers. Between them hangs a rusted iron gate, one side sagging open as if someone, or something, left it that way in anticipation of your arrival. As you roll past it, the air feels heavier, colder, like the woods themselves are holding their breath. Your car crawls down a long, uneven drive lined with weeds pushing up between old cobblestones; the tires thumping over the cracks. Fog gathers in thick, shifting curtains. For a moment, the world around you seems muffled, swallowed. 

Then you see it. 

Scarlet Manor emerges through the mist, rising from the dark like a memory refusing to stay buried. Its towering gables are blackened by time; the brickwork veined with ivy that clings like something alive. The tall, arched windows stare back with blank, glassy eyes... some cracked, some boarded over, all reflecting your headlights in fractured glimmers. The porch sags slightly under its own age, and yet the double doors still gleam faintly beneath their grime, painted a deep, almost wet-looking red. As you pull to a stop, a faint flicker of light dances behind one of the upper windows before vanishing as quickly as it appeared. The wind stirs, rattling a loose shutter, and for a moment you could swear the house lets out a long, quiet sigh. 

You kill the engine. Silence floods in... thick, expectant. 



Scarlet Manor awaits.
