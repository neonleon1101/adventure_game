The brass handles are cold beneath a thin film of grime, each one marked by deep gouges, as though someone once clawed at the door in desperation or fury.\n\nOff to your left, partly veiled by a heavy curtain of ivy; a single tall window watches the porch.

Your eyes adjust slowly, shapes taking form in the dim natural light that sneaks past the threshold behind you. The ceiling rises far higher than you expected... an immense, vaulted chamber crowned by a magnificent chandelier suspended low over the open floor. Its iron frame is a sprawling tangle of ornate scrollwork and curved arms, each one fitted with tall, unlit candles. Even in darkness, it radiates a kind of commanding presence, like a relic meant to be adored from below.\n\nYour gaze drifts outward. Twin staircases spiral upward from the left and right sides of the room, their carved banisters mirroring each other perfectly as they curve toward a mezzanine that spans the foyer like a suspended bridge. Straight ahead, beneath that mezzanine, a long hallway stretches into the depths of the house... narrow, dark, lined with doors that seem to lean subtly inward, as though listening. To your immediate right, an open doorway reveals the edge of a parlor draped in heavy curtains, faint shapes of furniture lurking inside. To your left, a large door stands firmly shut... tall and imposing.\n\nYou barely manage a breath before the front door behind you slams shut with violent force, the sound cracking through the chamber like a gunshot. A sharp metallic click follows... locked. In that same heartbeat, the chandelier above erupts to life as every candle ignites at once in a sudden burst of flame. Warm light floods the foyer as sconces along the walls flare open, revealing the house's full grandeur... and the hollow stillness beneath it.

The dirt parts with surprising softness, as though it's been disturbed not long ago. With a few careful scoops, the trowel strikes something solid... wood, faintly hollow-sounding under the blade. Brushing the soil aside, you reveal a small wooden box, its surface worn smooth and stained dark with age. The lid lifts with a reluctant creak, and inside, nestled against faded cloth, rests a brass key topped with a sharp, gleaming diamond-shaped head. As you loosen your grip on the trowel, it slips from your hand... yet before it touches the floor, it simply vanishes, leaving only the faint, uncanny sense, that it landed somewhere very... very far away.",
