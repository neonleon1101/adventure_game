The brass handles are cold beneath a thin film of grime, each one marked by deep gouges, as though someone once clawed at the door in desperation or fury.\n\nOff to your left, partly veiled by a heavy curtain of ivy; a single tall window watches the porch.

Your eyes adjust slowly, shapes taking form in the dim natural light that sneaks past the threshold behind you. The ceiling rises far higher than you expected... an immense, vaulted chamber crowned by a magnificent chandelier suspended low over the open floor. Its iron frame is a sprawling tangle of ornate scrollwork and curved arms, each one fitted with tall, unlit candles. Even in darkness, it radiates a kind of commanding presence, like a relic meant to be adored from below.\n\nYour gaze drifts outward. Twin staircases spiral upward from the left and right sides of the room, their carved banisters mirroring each other perfectly as they curve toward a mezzanine that spans the foyer like a suspended bridge. Straight ahead, beneath that mezzanine, a long hallway stretches into the depths of the house... narrow, dark, lined with doors that seem to lean subtly inward, as though listening. To your immediate right, an open doorway reveals the edge of a parlor draped in heavy curtains, faint shapes of furniture lurking inside. To your left, a large door stands firmly shut... tall and imposing.\n\nYou barely manage a breath before the front door behind you slams shut with violent force, the sound cracking through the chamber like a gunshot. A sharp metallic click follows... locked. In that same heartbeat, the chandelier above erupts to life as every candle ignites at once in a sudden burst of flame. Warm light floods the foyer as sconces along the walls flare open, revealing the house's full grandeur... and the hollow stillness beneath it.

Brushing the soil aside, you reveal a small wooden box, its surface worn smooth and stained dark with age. The lid lifts with a reluctant creak, and inside, nestled against faded cloth, rests a brass key topped with a sharp, gleaming diamond-shaped head. As you loosen your grip on the trowel, it slips from your hand... yet before it touches the floor, it simply vanishes, leaving only the faint, uncanny sense, that it landed somewhere very... very far away.",

The second door has a faint, lingering scent of dust and fabric drifting from its seams. The third door carries the slightest echo of tile beneath it, a coolness you can feel even from here. And the fourth door, though plain, seems to hum faintly with the restless stillness of a room that hasn't been opened in years.\n\nA glance upward reveals another detail: centered above the mezzanine ceiling is a closed drop-down attic ladder, its wooden frame tightly shut and far out of reach.

I tried to tell myself it was the house settling, but the boards creaked in the same rhythm they always did beneath her feet.\n\nI haven't stepped past the front stoop in weeks. Every time I get close, I see her silhouette in the doorway behind me. I turn, and of course nothing is there. Nothing ever is. But I can feel her. Sometimes I smell her perfume. Sometimes I hear her humming that lullaby she used to sing when she was nervous.\n\n\n\nShe wants me here.\n\nShe wants me to stay.\n\nOr she wants me to remember.\n\n\n\nI don't sleep anymore. When I close my eyes I see the shaft collapsing again, hear the screams, hear her voice above them all... accusing, pleading, echoing off the stone. I used to believe guilt was a weight a man carried inside. But this house carries it too. The walls remember. She remembers.\n\nI've thought about leaving. God knows I've tried. But every time I reach for the door, my hand shakes so violently I can't touch the knob. I know what waits for me outside. Judgment. Discovery. Her.\n\nAt least here, within these walls, I can pretend she's only a memory.\n\nA man can convince himself of many things, given enough silence.\n\nBut this house is never silent.\n\n\n\nNot anymore.",

As you lift your gaze, a figure hovers in the open air above... Eleanor. Her form drifts weightlessly, her features soft and distant, yet her eyes meet yours with a sharp, unmistakable awareness. She doesn't speak. Instead, her expression tightens with a kind of mournful urgency before her outline thins, dissolving into the air like mist caught in a draft.\n\nThe silence that follows lasts only a heartbeat.\n\nA violent crash erupts from beyond the doorway. The chandelier in the foyer plummets from the ceiling, hitting the floor with explosive force as flames burst outward in a sweeping ring. Fire races across the foyer in an instant, swallowing the walls in a roar of heat and smoke. Before you can react, the library door slams shut, the lock clacking shut with sharp finality.\n\nEleanor's voice glides through the library... not spoken aloud, but pressed into the air around you, old and aching with purpose:\n\n'Let the tale be told as it was lived...'\n\nAt her words, the candles mounted beneath each portrait flare into sudden blue flame, the unnatural fire licking upward. The canvases ignite without heat, burning away in eerie silence until new images emerge beneath the ash... different scenes, different faces, as though the paintings themselves have shed false histories to reveal what truly happened.\n\nThe room settles into a charged, waiting stillness. The story, it seems, is now yours to uncover.",
