Up close, the double front doors dominate your vision... tall, heavy slabs of dark wood stained a deep crimson that seems darker in the shadows, almost as if the color had seeped into the grain rather than been painted on. The brass handles are cold beneath a thin film of grime, each one marked by deep gouges, as though someone once clawed at the door in desperation or fury.\n\nOff to your left, partly veiled by a heavy curtain of ivy; a single tall window watches the porch. The glass is clouded with age, its reflection warped, yet you can faintly make out shapes and shadows shifting in the darkness beyond, their edges too soft and distant to understand from here. The wind stirs just enough to rattle a loose porch board behind you, though the rest of the air remains unnervingly still. Ahead, the red doors stand silent and waiting.",

The room beyond is dim and crowded, its walls lined with tall, shadow-soaked shapes that rise almost to the ceiling, and the floor is scattered with fallen objects that catch faint slivers of moonlight... papers, perhaps, or old bindings split from time. A large portrait hangs crooked on the far wall, its features swallowed by darkness, and something about the dense, orderly rows and the cluttered floor makes the space feel heavy, suffocating, meticulously filled.

The heavy door resists at first, then yields with a long, low groan, releasing a draft of stale, ancient air that spills out around you. As the darkness inside parts just enough to reveal the foyer beyond, you step over the threshold and let the house swallow the sound of the rain behind you.\n\nThe foyer swallows you in cold air the moment you step inside, the scent of dust and old varnish thick enough to taste. Your eyes adjust slowly, shapes taking form in the dim natural light that sneaks past the threshold behind you. The ceiling rises far higher than you expected... an immense, vaulted chamber crowned by a magnificent chandelier suspended low over the open floor. Its iron frame is a sprawling tangle of ornate scrollwork and curved arms, each one fitted with tall, unlit candles. Even in darkness, it radiates a kind of commanding presence, like a relic meant to be adored from below.\n\nYour gaze drifts outward. Twin staircases spiral upward from the left and right sides of the room, their carved banisters mirroring each other perfectly as they curve toward a mezzanine that spans the foyer like a suspended bridge. Straight ahead, beneath that mezzanine, a long hallway stretches into the depths of the house... narrow, dark, lined with doors that seem to lean subtly inward, as though listening. To your immediate right, an open doorway reveals the edge of a parlor draped in heavy curtains, faint shapes of furniture lurking inside. To your left, a large door stands firmly shut... tall and imposing.\n\nYou barely manage a breath before the front door behind you slams shut with violent force, the sound cracking through the chamber like a gunshot. A sharp metallic click follows... locked. In that same heartbeat, the chandelier above erupts to life as every candle ignites at once in a sudden burst of flame. Warm light floods the foyer as sconces along the walls flare open, revealing the house's full grandeur... and the hollow stillness beneath it. Whatever is here, it's not letting you leave anytime soon.",
